*Text action* allows the user to apply an action to a specific text entry. For instance, typing in an email address and then adding that to a list of other addresses. The preceeding glyph informs the user what the expected action will be.

## Usage
It is recommended to have some sort of hint text inside and/or label above your *text action* to indicate what kind of text input the user should type. Use text action in conjunction with other elements (e.g. form elements, submit button, etc.) in cases where collection or input of data is needed.

## Behavioral guidance
Avoid relying on *text action* for many text entries. Itâ€™s best used for applying actions to a few text entries.
